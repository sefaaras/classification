2.4 GHZ Indoor Channel Measurements Data Set

Abstract:
The frequency domain measurement of the scattering parameter, S21, of the wireless channel was carried out using the ZVB14 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) from Rhode and Schwartz. The measurement system consists of the VNA, low loss RF cables, and omnidirectional antennas at the transmitter and receiver ends. The transmitter and receiver heights were fixed at 1.5 m. A program script was written for the VNA to measure 10 consecutive sweeps: each sweep contains 601 frequency sample points with spacing of 0.167 MHz to cover a 100 MHz band centered at 2.4 GHz. The settings provided a high time-domain resolution of 10 nsec (inverse of the bandwidth) and a time span of (0.167 MHz) = 5.99 Î¼sec . The measurements were designed to examine the WiFi bands specifically, channels 1, 6, and 11 in the IEEE 802.11 standard.

The frequency domain channel measurements were conducted at Khalifa University campus in Sharjah, UAE. The measurements were done in 4 different locations:
1- Lab139 (highly cluttered)
2- Corridor_rm155 (medium cluttered) [with wall from one side and windows from the
other side].
3- Main_Lobby (low cluttered)
4- Sports_Hall (open space).
